# Knowledge and Snippet Database Backend

The backend implementation for the KS-Tool.

## Limitations

**This is a test project using a AWS educate account. As a result, some services were restricted and lacking features that were necessary for the project. As a result, you will need to build a cognito-stack yourself and put the cognito pools inside the serverless.yml.**

## Deploy

```shell
npx sls deploy --stage <STAGE>
```
